## Introduction
Welcome to my Django web application, a chatroom with an integrated AI Emotional Support Robot powered by Openai ChatGPT api. The platform allows users to engage in real-time conversations in chatrooms, providing a safe and comforting space to share thoughts. The AI Emotional Support Robot leverages the power of ChatGPT to provide intelligent and empathetic responses, enhancing the user experience and offering emotional support.
